  utter_what_bookkeeping:
  - text: Our Explanation of Bookkeeping provides you with a rich understanding of
      the recording of transactions. It then discusses the additional steps necessary
      for preparing accurate financial statements. This is great for bookkeepers of
      all skill levels and for small business owners.

  utter_basic_cost_accounting:
  - text: To get a basic understanding of cost accounting I recommend reading the
      managerial accounting topics found in the second half of an introductory accounting
      textbook. Such a textbook is often 1,200+ pages in length since it covers both
      financial and managerial accounting. (A textbook containing only financial accounting
      topics is not helpful.) A person in the U.S. should be able to obtain a 5-year-old
      edition of a 1,200-page introductory accounting textbook from a reseller on
      Amazon.com for approximately $5.
